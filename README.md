Module 2 Challenge Files

The code follows the example given in the Resources folder, except for one change:

<b>While the resources folder shows conditional formatting for the 'Yearly Change', the assignment awards points for conditional formatting of the 'Percent Change'
column as well, so therefore I have added the additional formatting to my code.</b>

I have also uploaded the alphabetical_testing.xlsx file that worked with my StockAnalysis.vbs code.
